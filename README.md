## [cojs](https://github.com/tj/co) [middleware](http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) for Redux.

`redux-co` is a drop-in replacement for [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) *(and indeed passes its [test suite](kilianc/redux-co/blob/master/test/index.js))*. It's meant to support async actions through *yieldables* as well as plain [thunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) functions.

    $ npm i --save-dev redux-co

## Motivation

> Redux Thunk [middleware](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/master/docs/advanced/Middleware.md) allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods `dispatch` and `getState()` as parameters.

## Usage

Then, to enable `redux-co`, use [`applyMiddleware()`](http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html):

```js
// store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import coMiddleware from 'redux-co'
import rootReducer from './reducers/index'

// create a store that has redux-co middleware enabled
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
  coMiddleware
)(createStore)

export default createStoreWithMiddleware(rootReducer)

```

```js
// actions.js

import { createAction } from 'redux-actions'
import github from './lib/github'

export const types = {
  USER_PROFILE_REQUEST: 'USER_PROFILE_REQUEST',
  USER_PROFILE_RECEIVE: 'USER_PROFILE_RECEIVE',
  SOMETHING_ELSE: 'SOMETHING_ELSE'
}

export const actions = {
  fetchUserProfile: createFetchUserProfileAction,
  requestUserProfile: createAction(types.USER_PROFILE_REQUEST),
  receiveUserProfile: createAction(types.USER_PROFILE_RECEIVE),
  somethingElse: createAction(types.SOMETHING_ELSE)
}

// we can dispatch multiple actions in the right order with
// sublime flow control. We are yielding a promise returned
// by our github api wrapper.
function createFetchUserProfileAction (username) {
  return function * (dispatch) {
    dispatch(actions.requestUserProfile(username))

    try {
      let data = yield github.getUserProfile(username)
      dispatch(actions.receiveUserProfile(data))
    } catch (err) {
      dispatch(actions.receiveUserProfile(err))
    }

    dispatch(actions.somethingElse())
  }
}

// we still support thunks!
function createFetchUserProfileAction (username) {
  return function (dispatch) {
    dispatch(actions.requestUserProfile(username))

    return github.getUserProfile(username)
      .then((data) => dispatch(actions.receiveUserProfile(data)))
      .catch((err) => dispatch(actions.receiveUserProfile(err)))
      .then(() => dispatch(actions.somethingElse()))
  }
}

```

The above examples achieve the same result using both thunks and generators, but being generators backed up by [cojs](https://github.com/tj/co) allows us to yield [*all the things!*](https://github.com/tj/co#yieldables)

## Composition

> Any return value from the inner function will be available as the return value of `dispatch` itself. This is convenient for orchestrating an asynchronous control flow with thunk action creators dispatching each other and returning Promises to wait for each otherâ€™s completion.

# How to contribute

This project follows the awesome [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/about/) [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

* You must add a new feature on its own branch
* You must contribute to hot-fixing, directly into the master branch (and pull-request to it)

This project uses [standardjs](https://github.com/feross/standard) to enforce a consistent code style. Your contribution must be pass standard validation.

The test suite is written on top of [mochajs/mocha](http://mochajs.org/). Use the tests to check if your contribution breaks some part of the library and be sure to add new tests for each new feature.

    $ npm test
